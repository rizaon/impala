/// The Impala CatalogServer manages the caching and persistence of cluster-wide metadata.
/// The CatalogServer aggregates the metadata from the Hive Metastore, the NameNode,
/// and potentially additional sources in the future. The CatalogServer uses the
/// Statestore to broadcast metadata updates across the cluster.
/// The CatalogService directly handles executing metadata update requests
/// (DDL requests) from clients via a Thrift interface.
/// The CatalogServer has two main components - a C++ daemon that has the Statestore
/// integration code, Thrift service implementiation, and exporting of the debug
/// webpage/metrics.
/// The other main component is written in Java and manages caching and updating of all
/// metadata. For each Statestore heartbeat, the C++ Server queries the Java metadata
/// cache over JNI to get the current state of the catalog. Any updates are broadcast to
/// the rest of the cluster using the Statestore over the IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC.
/// The CatalogServer must be the only writer to the IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC, meaning there
/// cannot be multiple CatalogServers running at the same time, as the correctness of
/// delta updates relies upon this assumption.
///
/// Catalog HA:
/// To support catalog HA, we add the preemptive behavior for catalogd. When enabled,
/// the preemptive behavior allows the catalogd with the higher priority to become active
/// and the paired catalogd becomes standby. The active catalogd acts as the source of
/// metadata and provides catalog service for the Impala cluster.
/// By default, preemption is disabled on the catalogd which is running as single catalog
/// instance in an Impala cluster. For deployment with catalog HA, the preemption must
/// be enabled with starting flag "enable_catalogd_ha" on both the catalogd in the HA pair
/// and statestore.
/// The catalogd in an Active-Passive HA pair can be assigned an instance priority value
/// to indicate a preference for which catalogd should assume the active role. The
/// registration ID which is assigned by statestore can be used as instance priority
/// value. The lower numerical value in registration ID corresponds to a higher priority.
/// The catalogd with the higher priority is designated as active, the other catalogd is
/// designated as standby. Only the active catalogd propagates the IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC
/// to the cluster. This guarantees only one writer for the IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC in a
/// Impala cluster.
/// Statestore only send the IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC messages to active catalogd. Also
/// catalogds are registered as writer for IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC so the standby catalogd
/// does not receive catalog updates from statestore. When standby catalogd becomes
/// active, its "last_sent_catalog_version_" member variable is reset. This will lead to
/// non-delta catalog update for next IMPALA_CATALOG_TOPIC which also instructs the
/// statestore to clear all entries for the catalog update topic, so that statestore keeps
/// in-sync with new active catalogd for the catalog update topic.
/// statestore which is the registration center of an Impala cluster assigns the roles
/// for the catalogd in the HA pair after both catalogd register to statestore. When
/// statestore detects the active catalogd is not healthy, it fails over catalog service
/// to standby catalogd. When failover occurs, statestore sends notifications with the
/// address of active catalogd to all coordinators and catalogd in the cluster. The event
/// is logged in the statestore and catalogd logs. When the catalogd with the higher
/// priority recovers from a failure, statestore does not resume it as active to avoid
/// flip-flop between the two catalogd.
/// To make a specific catalogd in the HA pair as active instance, the catalogd must be
/// started with starting flag "force_catalogd_active" so that the catalogd will be
/// assigned with active role when it registers to statestore. This allows administrator
/// to manually perform catalog service failover.
